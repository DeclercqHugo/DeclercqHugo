### Hi, I'm Declercq hugo 👋 
I'm a young developer 🧑🏻‍💻 with a bachelor's degree in business computing and I'm currently training at school 19 (same school as 42 in Paris) but in **Belgium** 🇧🇪.  
Right now I'm trying to finish the last mandatory projects from school 19 💯.  
🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++.  
🤔 I'd like to learn Unity and Python 🐍.  
⚡ Fun fact: I've been swimming for over 15 years 🏊‍♂️.
